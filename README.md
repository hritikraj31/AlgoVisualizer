[Visualize](https://algo-visualizer-1.herokuapp.com/) how algorithms Dijkstra and A* works in grid!

# Features

* See Difference between algorithms (Dijkstra and A*) visually.
* Create walls in the grid using your mouse.
* Create nice random maze using maze algorithms provided.


# Tech Stack

Backend of the project had been done using Nodejs and Express. Two algorithms have been implemented (Dijkstra and A*). A* additonally uses Min Heap which had been implemented in utils folder.

Two maze generation algorithm have been implemented
- Recursive Division of the Maze
- Prim's Algorithm for Maze division

For frontend only HTML and CSS has been used.
